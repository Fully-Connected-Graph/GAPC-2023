## About

The Groningen Algorithmic Programming Contest (GAPC) is a 4 hour competitive programming contest, where students from (but not limited to) University of Groningen form teams of 1 to 3 people. The target is to solve the most problems and win the champion's cup.

The event will take place on the Saturday 29th of April in the Bernoulliborg, at the Study Landscape from 11:00 - 20:00. 


## Remember how it was last year?

## About

The Groningen Algorithmic Programming Contest (GAPC) is a 4 hour competitive programming contest, where students from (but not limited to) University of Groningen form teams of 1 to 3 people. The target is to solve the most problems and win the champion's cup.

The event will take place on the Saturday 29th of April in the Bernoulliborg, at the Study Landscape from 11:00 - 20:00.

Fully Connected Graph, also known as FCG, is a committee whose aim is to create an environment where students can improve and test their technical abilities.


In the present, our main focus represents the events about competitive programming, but we expect to extend our range of events in the next academic year.

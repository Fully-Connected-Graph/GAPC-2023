The target is to solve the most problems and win the champion's cup.\r\n\r\nThe event will take place on the Saturday 29th of April in the Bernoulliborg, at the Study Landscape from 11:00 - 20:00. This is a full-day event, where not only the lunch and dinner will be provided, but also you'll have the chance to interact with our partner companies and feel the ICPC-style event vibe. More details about the schedule can be found <a href=\"https://fully-connected-graph.github.io/GAPC-2023/schedule/\">\r\nhere.\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n## Contest\r\n\r\nThis contest is open to all students from a university within the Benelux region.
